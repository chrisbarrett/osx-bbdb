#+TITLE: OS X bbdb importer
#+AUTHOR: Chris Barrett

* Description

Provides a command, =import-osx-contacts-to-bbdb=, that will copy contacts from
your OS X Address Book into BBDB. It also uses a timer to periodically add new contacts.

Requires Emacs 24+, tested on OS X 10.8.

* Installation
Execute the code below in an elisp buffer.

This utility requires a few additional packages, which will be automatically
downloaded by Emacs' package manager.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE emacs-lisp
  (require 'package)
  ;; Ensure melpa repository is added.
  (add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "http://melpa.milkbox.net/packages/"))
  (package-initialize)
  ;; Install directly from github.
  (with-current-buffer (url-retrieve-synchronously "github url")
    (call-interactively 'package-install-from-buffer))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Once you've install the package, add the following to your /init.el/:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE emacs-lisp
  (when (equal system-type 'darwin)
    (require 'osx-bbdb))
#+END_EXAMPLE

* Contributing
- TODO Merge fields for existing contacts, instead of skipping.
