#+TITLE: OS X bbdb importer
#+AUTHOR: Chris Barrett

* Description

Provides a command, =import-osx-contacts-to-bbdb=, that will copy contacts from
your OS X Address Book into BBDB. It also uses a timer to periodically add new contacts.

Requires Emacs 24+, tested on OS X 10.8.

* Installation
#+BEGIN_SRC
brew install contacts
#+END_SRC

then paste the code below into an elisp buffer, then =M-x eval-buffer=.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'package)
  ;; Ensure melpa repository is added.
  (add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "http://melpa.milkbox.net/packages/"))
  (package-initialize)
  ;; Install directly from github.
  (with-current-buffer (url-retrieve-synchronously
                        "https://raw.github.com/chrisbarrett/osx-bbdb/master/osx-bbdb.el")
    (call-interactively 'package-install-from-buffer))
#+END_SRC

This utility requires a few additional packages, which will be automatically
downloaded by Emacs' package manager.

Once you've installed the package, add the following to your /init.el/:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (when (equal system-type 'darwin)
    (require 'osx-bbdb))
#+END_SRC

* Contributing
- TODO Merge fields for existing contacts, instead of skipping.
